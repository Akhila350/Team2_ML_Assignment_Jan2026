📊 Census Income Prediction – 5-Week Machine Learning Project:  
            This repository contains our 5-week team-based machine learning project focused on analyzing the UCI Adult (Census Income) dataset.The objective of this project is to understand real-world structured data, apply end-to-end machine learning workflows, and build classification models to predict whether an individual’s annual income exceeds $50,000 based on demographic and socioeconomic features.

Over the course of five weeks, we systematically cover:

1) Data understanding and variable analysis

2) Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering

3) Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

4) Model building using supervised learning algorithms

5) Model evaluation, comparison, and performance optimization

   This project emphasizes collaborative development, reproducibility, and clear documentation, following industry-standard ML practices and version control using GitHub.

Dataset:

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Adult Census Income Dataset

Type: Structured tabular data (categorical + numerical)

Task: Binary classification (<=50K vs >50K)
